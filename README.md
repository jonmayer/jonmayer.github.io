A little work will end up here.

## Projects

* [derelict](derelict/index.html): a random derelict spaceship generator for
  the [Mothership RPG](https://www.mothershiprpg.com/dead-planet), inspired on
  the dice-based generator in [Dead
  Planet](https://www.mothershiprpg.com/dead-planet).

* [gee](https://github.com/jonmayer/gee): a porcelain wrapper for git and gh.
  Thousands of lines of bash, that I promise to rewrite in python soon.

* [verilogpp](https://github.com/jonmayer/verilogpp): a verilog preprocessor
  that implements emacs verilog-mode like automation, but in a more scriptable,
  repeatable form.  I've written a version of this script at nearly every
  company I ever worked at, but Google finally allowed me to open source it.

* [pyvm]: UVM, re-imagined as a python framework.
