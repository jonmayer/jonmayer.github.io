# Derelict

A derelict ship generator for the Mothership RPG.

## Overview

Derelict is inspired by the dice-based derelict ship generator from 
[Dead Planet](https://www.mothershiprpg.com/dead-planet), a scenario
for [Mothership RPG](https://www.mothershiprpg.com/).

It is not meant to be a complete game, or even a game scenario, but
instead provides some atmosphere and a framework on which a Warden
can hang more interesting stories.
